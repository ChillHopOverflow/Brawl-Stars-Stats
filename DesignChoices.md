## Bootstrap Stuff

We have decided to use monotone. 

1. I want to add page transition. What do you like best? 
* [Top/Side](https://codepen.io/hannesofie/pen/aplGf)
* [Simple Fade](https://christopheraue.net/design/fading-pages-on-load-and-unload)
* [Color Fade](https://www.codeply.com/p/VrZv1pNUPw)
* [Others](https://onaircode.com/bootstrap-page-transitions-effect-examples/)

2. If we want to get fancy with our buttons: 
* [fancy button](https://codepen.io/EvyatarDa/pen/waKXMd)

3. Also should we have a company name/logo (for our projects)? If so what would you like it to be?

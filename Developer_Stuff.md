# Some Documentation for Devs

## Planning

### Short Term Goals

**Home Page**
* Table items: name, trophies/highest trophies, level, best time as big brawler or robo rumble

**Pages**
* About / Core Values / Contact Us

**Demo Website**
* Get a demo website on github.io 
* If we wanted to actually run it, it would cost ~ $25/month (domain and hosting)

### Stretch Goals

**MongoDB**
* To store data (over time)

**Expand Home Page**
* Add battle logs and other data to our home page

## Resources
### Useful things

* [These](https://brawlstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) docs that explains Brawl Stars API might be useful
* The theme's [home page](https://themesguide.github.io/top-hat/dist/monotone/) we are using

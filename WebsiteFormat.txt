CURRENT TROPHIES & HIGHEST TROPHIES (Stacked Bar Chart)
A stacked bar chart displaying the current and highest trophies for each brawler.

In order to emulate an overlapping graph, 
we will use the "difference between highest and current trophies" in place of the "highest trophies". 
This is so that the current and highest trophies of each brawler won't add together in the y axis;
as a result the top of each bar should only reach the highest trophies for each brawler in the y axis.
